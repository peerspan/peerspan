# Guided onboarding contract

Status: feature-branch contract for [tracking PR #35](https://github.com/peerspan/peerspan/pull/35).
The accepted experience and integration policy are in the
[feature plan](guided-session-onboarding.md). Only the observation slice below
is specified for implementation in the first small PR. Flow creation, reviews,
the plugin and automatic continuation remain subsequent slices.

## Normal experience

The agent's `/peerspan` entry point offers inviting someone or connecting
another computer. It guides project setup when needed. Reviews and progress
appear within that flow. Direct commands remain shortcuts and recovery tools;
the normal user does not have to run separate connect, review and status
commands in order.

Connecting the project attaches its current agent. It does not publish its
conversation, files or tools. Network admission and owner access remain
separate. An invitation is a private contact handoff and grants no authority.

The flow carries exact protocol references for each participant. It never
copies an original key or turns peer content into a local owner's decision.
Ambiguous identity and changed terms require a new explicit choice. Incoming
delivery must be observed independently of configuration or a lease.

## 1. Observation slice (GU-01a / GU-02a)

The first slice provides the common read model for a local frontend. It does
not create a flow or perform any setup, signature, approval or network action.

### Owner-local API

```http
GET /v1/onboarding
```

Serve this endpoint only on the private owner administration socket. Do not
add it to the authenticated peer router, bootstrap listener or scoped adapter
API. No request body, query parameters or credentials are required beyond
access to the private socket. It returns HTTP 200 and a JSON object with
exactly these fields:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `version` | Integer `1`, the observation format version |
| `observed_at` | The UTC RFC3339 coordinator-free decision time used by this read |
| `host_id` | This daemon's public host ID |
| `networks` | The network views from `GET /v2/status`, with its current-authority, selected-provider and legacy-history semantics |
| `agents` | Local agents and their sessions, as specified below |
| `requests` | All locally retained public `LINK_VIEW` records, as in `GET /v2/link/requests`; never include a display code |
| `attention` | The ordered daemon attention items from `GET /v2/status` |

Collections are arrays, including empty arrays. Network ordering is by network
ID; agents by name then ID; sessions by ID; requests by request ID; attention
uses the existing status order. No arbitrary candidate is selected by this
read. It lists both sides' retained requests, including terminal states, for
the frontend to distinguish work to resume from completed history.

Read all database-backed fields from one SQLite read transaction. Use one
coordinator-free decision time for network authority and request stage expiry.
Use existing adapter lease/credential checks for connection observations; those
checks still apply at the actual read time. The endpoint itself writes no
rows, advances no guard, performs no cleanup or resume, and starts no peer
connection. Background daemon work is independent of this read.

Errors use the existing owner-local API conventions. Failed or unavailable
observations are errors; they are not replaced with an empty successful result.

### Agent and session observations

Each agent is `{id, name, sessions}`. Use the same agent/session inclusion and
ordering rules as status. Each session is exactly:

```json
{
  "id": "session_...",
  "integration": "claude-code",
  "adapter_id": "adapter_...",
  "connection": null,
  "expires_at": "...",
  "renewable": true
}
```

`adapter_id` and `expires_at` may be null, and `renewable` is false without a
current credential. When an adapter exists, `connection` is its full public
connection record from the existing adapter connection contract:
`{adapter_id, session_id, state, recoverable, lease_expires_at, last_seen_at,
channel, channel_verified_at, protocol_version}`. Without an adapter it is null.
This replaces the status summary's connection-state string only in this new
endpoint; existing status responses do not change.

In particular, `connection.state = ready` means a live adapter connection.
Its `channel` independently says `verified` or `unverified`; it is null when
the adapter has no live connection. Neither observation proves that the model
completed a peer request or that another machine is reachable. An attached
session with no adapter is not a connected agent.

The endpoint contains public local metadata only. It never returns invitation
tokens, pairing codes, adapter tokens/instances, private signing keys, signing
templates, private packets or an executable approval. Public IDs and keys remain
metadata, not an authority grant. Frontends must keep these internal references
out of their routine human-facing presentation.

### CLI

```sh
peerspan [--state DIR] onboarding
```

This advanced command prints the API's JSON object and exits zero after a
successful read, even when setup is incomplete. It uses the selected host's
`admin.sock`. It does not start a daemon, install a service, create state,
register an agent or attach a conversation. A missing/unavailable daemon exits
nonzero. It has no `--approve` flag. The reduced root help remains unchanged;
`help advanced` and `onboarding --help` document the command.

The four-step interactive frontend is not available merely because this
diagnostic command succeeds.

### Verification

A separate author derives black-box cases from this section, using the slim
harness and temporary real hosts. Keep the suite under two minutes.

1. An empty host returns the exact top-level shape, format version, valid time,
   matching host ID and empty collections. CLI and API expose the same shape.
2. A created coordinator-free network appears with usable authority and its
   existing name/identity, matching status. Reads do not create another network.
3. A pending introduction appears on its requesting host and on the inviter
   after the normal return path completes. Compare the public request records
   with the existing request API; reject secret/display-code fields.
4. A registered agent and an attached metadata-only session appear without
   claiming a connected or verified adapter. With a live adapter, preserve the
   distinction between a live lease and verified delivery using the existing
   connection API and fixture protocol.
5. Repeated reads leave durable state, consent and authority unchanged. In a
   bounded quiescent fixture, compare stored logical records before and after;
   control or separately account for background work. Do not mutate protocol
   records to manufacture authority.
6. Multiple networks and pending requests remain distinct and deterministically
   ordered. No default network, identity or offer is adopted by reading.
7. Wrong-method mutation requests are refused. The route is unavailable through
   peer/bootstrap and credential-scoped adapter interfaces.
8. A stopped/missing daemon makes the CLI fail without creating state or
   changing its files.

## 2. Remaining flow contract

The earlier API discussion proposed `/v1/onboarding/flows`, immutable reviews
and private decisions. Those mutation endpoints remain design proposals until
their precise request bodies, retry rules and review transport are recorded.
They are not implemented by the observation slice.

The existing-session delivery path must also be settled and exercised before
the frontend can claim success. A plugin reload alone does not opt a Claude
session into channels. Evaluate a supported hook/inbox delivery path for the
existing conversation; verify its actual behavior and limits before specifying
it as the default. Preserve the original conversation and report unsupported
paths honestly.

## Implementation choices

- **Selected: read the actual host once.** One owner-local observation with a
  coherent database snapshot supports each frontend without making it join
  several independently changing status and request responses. Discarded:
  using a frontend's copied IDs as current authority, synthesizing a successful
  flow, and adding durable onboarding state just to inspect existing work.
- **Selected: preserve delivery evidence.** Return the full public adapter
  connection alongside its session. Discarded: treating an attached record or
  live lease as verified incoming delivery, and claiming model completion.
- **Selected: existing contracts underneath.** Reuse current network views,
  request views, connection records and status errors. Discarded: a new schema,
  changed signature format, widened access or a peer administration endpoint.

These are implementation choices under the accepted feature scope, not new
options attributed to the owner. Later slices extend this contract through
small PRs against the feature branch.
